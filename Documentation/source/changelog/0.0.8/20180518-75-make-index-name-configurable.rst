Feature 75 "Make index name configurable"
==========================================

Prior to the change the index name was not changeable and hardcoded to `typo3content`.
Now you can change the index name for different use cases.

You can now use one Elasticsearch server for multiple TYPO3 installations or multiple environments.

The default is set to `typo3content`. No changes are necessary.

See :issue:`75`.
