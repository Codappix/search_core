Installation
============

The extension can be installed through composer::

    composer require "leonmrni/search_core dev-feature/integrate-elasticsearch"

or by `downloading`_ and placing it inside the :file:`typo3conf/ext`-Folder of your installation.

Afterwards you need to enable the extension through the extension manager and include the static
typoscript setup.
